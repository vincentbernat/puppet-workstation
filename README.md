Configuring my workstations with puppet
=======================================

The intent is similar to [Boxen][] but I am using Linux and have used
a simpler system. The idea is to keep configuration of all my
workstations here. In fact, the configuration is partial as I
synchronize my homes with [Unison][].

It is quite unlikely to do anything right for you.

[Boxen]: https://boxen.github.com/
[Unison]: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/

This requires:

 - Debian unstable
 - `puppet` package
