[Service]
Type=simple
User=<%= @user %>
WorkingDirectory=~
PAMName=login
TTYPath=/dev/tty8
UtmpIdentifier=tty8

# Switching to the TTY is needed to get the appropriate rights from
# logind for rootless X. X does not seem to succeed doing it itself
# (xf86OpenConsole: VT_ACTIVATE failed: Operation not permitted) but
# it also tries too late.
#
# For more information about how logind provides access to devices,
# see https://dvdhrm.wordpress.com/2013/08/25/sane-session-switching/.
# It does not match exactly the current implementation (method names
# have changed), but it seems accurate on the concepts.
#
# chvt needs the tty to be attached to standard input to work. systemd
# sets the TERM variable environment in this case and it gets
# inherited by the X session. We do not want that.

UnsetEnvironment=TERM
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/chvt 8

# Ensure the session type is set to x11 to allow xss-lock to set idle hint
